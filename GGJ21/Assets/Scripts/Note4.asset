  noteText: "It\u2019s oh so much clearer now. Someone IS here with me. I can hear
    them. I can. Really. Because they stink. Lying in that puddle there. White robes,
    silver tubes but oh so familiar. And delicious. Oh, be still my starving fingers!
    It can tell me why my head hurts. Why I can\u2019t feel my face. Like wet clay.
    Like pudding but in strips as it slides away. Was it mine? Is it still mine?
    I can\u2019t resist. Like Christmas morning. Stare down at the pair of glassy
    baubles. Unwrap the ribbons. Peel away the dripping imitation and reveal\u2026
    Me."
