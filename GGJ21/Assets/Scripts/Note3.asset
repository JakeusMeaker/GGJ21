  noteText: "The power has gone. Sitting. I\u2019m just. Sitting, waiting. And it\u2019s
    suddenly just- CLACK. And there\u2019s no lights. I can\u2019t find anything.
    The wards all look the same and I can\u2019t find ANYTHING. So I\u2019m sitting.
    I\u2019m sitting trying to remember why I\u2019m here. And there go the lights!
    It\u2019s awful. Anyway, I keep sitting. In the dark now. And I hear someone.
    Something? It sounds like they\u2019re calling for me but my head hurts SO MUCH
    that my face is going numb. And my thoughts are slipping through my brain like
    snakes over glass. Is it just in my mind? Should I find them? Should I hide?
    Should I just\u2026 keep sitting?"
