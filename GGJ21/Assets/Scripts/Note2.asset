  noteText: "I was feeling a bit stronger. I can walk now, so I decided to try and
    find someone. Or even just get out of the hospital. But the place is a labyrinth.
    I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember where my ward was in relation to
    the others, and there\u2019s no signs or maps or anything. And that got me thinking.
    I can\u2019t even remember the name of the hospital. I can\u2019t remember why
    I\u2019m in here at all. My head is STILL killing me, so maybe that\u2019s it,
    but I don\u2019t think I had the headache a few days ago. I honestly can\u2019t
    remember\u2026"
