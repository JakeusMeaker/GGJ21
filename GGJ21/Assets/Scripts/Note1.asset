  noteText: "What on earth is going on? I\u2019d been the only patient on my ward
    for weeks, but now there\u2019s no one here at all. Doctor Miller told me that
    they were short-staffed, they\u2019d had to a few of the doctors to other wards,
    and he\u2019d be checking on me from now on. But that was days ago, and I haven\u2019t
    seen him since. I haven\u2019t seen anyone! I stayed in my bed for about two
    days. I think? Eventually, I got too hungry, so I\u2019ve been eating from a
    box of puddings I found outside of my door since then. I\u2019m so weak I can
    barely stand, let alone walk, and I have a headache that just seems to be getting
    worse. Someone will come back to get me soon. Anyway, as there\u2019s nothing
    to read, I suppose I will keep writing this. Perhaps I can give it to my lawyer."
